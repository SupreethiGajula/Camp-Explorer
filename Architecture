## Architecture Decisions

### Why MVC?
I used the MVC pattern to separate concerns:
- Models handle data
- Views handle UI
- Controllers handle logic

This improves maintainability and scalability.

### Why Middleware?
Middleware is used for:
- Authentication checks
- Validation
- Error handling

This avoids code duplication.
