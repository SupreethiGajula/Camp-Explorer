## Architecture Decisions

### Why MVC?
I used the MVC pattern to separate concerns:
- Models handle data
- Views handle UI
- Controllers handle logic

This improves maintainability and scalability.

### Why Middleware?
Middleware is used for:
- Authentication checks
- Validation
- Error handling

This avoids code duplication.

### Multiple Images
Ideally it is not good to store images in mongoDB.So if a user want to upload any images i.e., more than one image for a campground, cloud is better.
Initially using Cloudinary for simplicity.
**Later migrating to AWS S3 to understand cloud storage.**
